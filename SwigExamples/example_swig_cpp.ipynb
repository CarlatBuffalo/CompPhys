    "\n",
    "It is also possible to use our C++ code from python and Jupyter. This involves using the [SWIG](http://www.swig.org) package. You can download it [here](http://www.swig.org/survey.html) and then install following instructions [here](http://www.swig.org/Doc3.0/Preface.html#Preface_installation). If you are successful, you should be able to open a new terminal and type ```which swig``` to obtain the path of swig. \n",

    "The idea is then to use SWIG to automatically generate python-readable code from our \"cpt\" C++/C libraries. There is a lot to learn in this regard, so we will try first with a simple example that illustrates some concepts we will need, such as using STL libraries and C++11 compilation. \n"

The reason this must be done instead of using a python ```list``` object is because python does not have a \"native\" notion of ```std::vector<int>```. It can convert python lists to C++ arrays, but not to ```std::vector```. To make it more transparent, you could copy the elements into a python list, but that is expensive computationally. You could also convert the ```std::vector``` to a C++ array inside your C++ code, in which case you need not use this. However, for performant usage of ```std::vector``` in python with SWIG, stick to using the implementation from ```std_vector.i```. \n",
